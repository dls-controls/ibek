## Documentation Standards

Docstrings are pre-processed using the Sphinx Napoleon extension. As such,
[google-style] is considered as standard for this repository. Please use type
hints in the function signature for types. For example:

```python
def func(arg1: str, arg2: int) -> bool:
    """Summary line.

    Extended description of function.

    Args:
        arg1: Description of arg1
        arg2: Description of arg2

    Returns:
        Description of return value
    """
    return True
```

Documentation is contained in the `docs` directory and extracted from
docstrings of the API.

Docs follow the underlining convention:

```
Headling 1 (page title)
=======================

Heading 2

Heading 3
~~~~~~~~~
```
